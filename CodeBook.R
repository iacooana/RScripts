Assumptions are:
  - there are 1022 instances of the data with 562 measurements on 6 activities; this data is split between test and train data as per readme


# Based on features info the measurements that contain mean are: mean(); meanFreq();
# and gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean - all used on the angle() variable
# Standard deviation is represented only by: std()
# while energy() sounds like a mean measure, I am excluding this.
